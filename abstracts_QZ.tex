{This poster describes an ongoing GAMA2 project, is dealing with the method for in-situ rock mass strain measurement. Resistance tensiometry (Koshinuma et al., 1972) is widely used for strain measurements in the field of automotive, civil engineering or mining industries (Rocha et al., 1969). However, in such an application, strain gauges are measuring relatively homogeneous material, such as steel or concrete, usually in controlled laboratory conditions. Our ongoing project aims to modify this method for direct rock mass strain measurement. In comparison with traditional geotechnical strain monitoring methods (flat jack, strain tensiometer) is resistance tensiometry cheaper alternative, with potentially higher precision (Murray et al, 1992).

In the natural environment, the results of tensiometry are affected by meteorological variables mainly by temperature. Our goals are 1) to compile measuring instrumentation that can withstand natural conditions a can be placed directly within rock slopes, and 2) to propose a methodology for the elimination of meteorological factors influence. 

For that purpose new test site \enquote{Na požárech} 30 km from Prague was established. On this site, a weather station, thermocouples, and in-depth rock mass temperature monitoring were established. Recently strain gauges in different geometries were placed on rock slope surfaces. We are using simple quarter bridges or half-bridges, or more complex full bridges/tensiometric roses. By these, we can measure the one- or two-dimensional strain of rock slope surface. By complex full bridges/roses we should be able to determine the direction of rock mass surface strain. Simple one-dimensional strain gauges measure the dynamic of microcrack and undamaged rock mass. To validate the results of tensiometry, conventional resistance and vibrating wire crack meters are installed nearby the resistance crack gauges. 

In this semi-controlled environment, we can observe the influence of meteorological variables on results. The project’s final phase is to propose a methodology for in-situ rock mass tensiometry data processing and propose it for public use, together with proof measuring instrumentation.

{Flash floods are a dangerous phenomenon that usually affects small drainage basins. They are primarily initiated in the upper parts of the slopes, but their injuring effects are manifested mostly in residential areas, where underground channelized streams disappeared from the surface. Therefore, there are not precise data about stream water levels available and only using surface runoff modelling is possible to simulate what happened during flash floods. Karlova Ves (Bratislava city District), formerly a small viniculture village, was threatened by floods (most probably including those of pluvial type) in the history. In this paper, we simulate surface runoff of a flash flood that occurred in the summer of 2014 in the catchment of Čierny potok using r.sim.water module in GRASS GIS. The flood in August 2014 was reported as with the highest rainfall per hour \textasciitilde40mm during the time of local meteorological measurements. Current orthophotomap was used to classify CLC land cover classes, which were assigned the value of the Manning’s roughness coefficient and infiltration rate. The topography was expressed by DTM from high resolution LiDAR data. Our preliminary results indicate that land cover and land use are the essential factors influencing flash floods initiation, although the main driver in lower infiltration and change in flow direction is caused by urbanisation and high proportion of impervious areas. The simulation using r.sim.water module showed that during 60-minute extreme rainfall (40mm/hr) a surface runoff can reach a water depth up to 2 meters in terrain depressions by maximum discharge of 25 cubic meters per second. Natural urban areas revitalisation with increasing the vegetation cover in the areas prone to water flow and accumulation during higher rainfalls helps to prevent the damage caused by floods.

{The paper aims to create a detailed automatic classification of the river landscape habitats based on high-resolution data obtained by drones. We apply automatic classification of the floodplain landscape structure and in-channel physical habitats. As part of automated classification, we test the accuracy of pixel-based and object-oriented supervised classification, using data sets composed of traditional spectral characteristics (RGB) and the geometric properties of the point cloud. The channel bathymetry was identified by modelling the relationship between spectral parameters of the image and field measured water depth or by the correction of the photogrammetrically generated bathymetry model by the refraction coefficient. The accuracy of the automatic classification was evaluated based on KAPPA indices using the validation layer, and the RMSE error was used for bathymetric models. In total, we classify nine main classes of land cover: water; low vegetation (less than 0.5 m); medium vegetation (0.5 - 3 m); high vegetation (more than 3 m); gravel bar; flood facies; bedrock and LWD. The submerged physical morphology was divided into four classes based on water depth. For object-oriented classification on the data layer using only the colour spectrum RGB, the accuracy of vegetation classification was 98.1 \%. The water depth in the riverbed was identified based on a bathymetric model with a determination coefficient of 0.8161 and an RMSE error of 0.2419 m. The physical habitat in the river includes different continuums (grain size, water depth, topographic elevation and flow velocity) as a main physical river habitat parameter constituted by the flow regime (hydrology and hydraulics) and the physical template (fluvial sedimentology and geomorphology). Physical habitat parameters will be extracted from a detailed bathymetry model, reconstructing the channel bed structure, gravel bars and identifying habitat patterns essential for maintaining fish assemblage biodiversity. From hydraulic modelling, we used flow velocity. For final class mapping, we used velocity data, water depth and morphology unit classification (pool, glide, run, riffle).

{Unlike caves, abandoned underground mines have been rather out of side scientists interest (Lenart, 216). Compared to the other subterranean geosystems, the geomorphology of abandoned underground mines remain low investigated (Hill and Forti, 1997). The complex spectrum of geomorphic forms was never described from abandoned underground mines. The works about abandoned mines are mostly focused on mature rock, hydrothermal veins composition analyses or discoveries of new minerals. From the risk assessment point of view, abandoned underground mines present threat for human health and environmental risk (Wichert, 2020). However, in recent years, these mines play more important role in nature conservation as habitat for bats, preservation of cultural heritage or tourist management. This research brings the results of one of the first complex geomorphological investigations of abandoned underground slate mines from Nízký Jeseník Upland. Various types of subterranean geomorphic forms were described from 114 mines. Forms, evaluated according to their type, scale, frequency and fragility, are independent on each other, or embedded. The range of described geomorphic forms together and measured crack shifts point to rich geodiversity and high dynamics within the abandoned mines.

{Monitoring of slope deformations is a key tool for determining both the activity of the studied landforms and landslide hazard. Utilization of a geophysical monitoring represents one of the ways to monitor the physical parameters of the observed slope deformation. The contribution summarizes the advantages of landslide monitoring using the time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography method, and, presents the gradual development of such monitoring from simple repeated measurements on fixed electrodes to the state-of-the-art time-lapse DAEMON system (Directly Accessed geoElectrical MONitoring system) that we have invented for this purpose. This system has already been installed at the Čeřeniště Natural Lab, which represents a complex slope deformation with all types of slope processed involved. It is a comprehensive system of measurements on buried electrodes with a direct access and an option to adjust the parameters and frequency of measurements remotely. The data are, at the same time, automatically sent to a remote storage, where they are automatically statistically processed and presented in a selected graphical form (e.g. a graph). The entire system thus combines the automated resistivity measurements, its remote control and data transfer with an automatic assessment of the results using our self-invented DAEMON software. The resistivity measurements are carried out to capture moisture changes in the section across the flowslide part of the investigated slope deformation and the causal connections among \enquote{precipitation – infiltration – moisture changes – landslide reactivation} are analysed. If we would determine the threshold for the measured physical parameter (apparent resistivity) or for derived values of soil moisture respectively, a warning message can be sent when these set values are reached or exceeded. In principle, the entire system provides a functional basis for a possible early warning system that could be used to monitor dangerous slope deformations. The question for future experimental research is to find a way to determine the threshold values used in a landslide hazard assessment.

{The Laboratory of Dendrogeomorphology (\url{dendroman.cz}) is the only specialized workplace in the Czech Republic focused exclusively on the dating of geomorphological processes through the analysis of tree rings. The main working method of the laboratory is dendrogeomorphological analysis, which uses dendrochronological techniques to date various geomorphological processes. The only condition is that the process being studied must be able to influence tree growth in some way (directly, e.g. by damaging the stem or indirectly, e.g. by destroying neighbouring trees). The laboratory has extensive experience in the analysis of debris flows, rockfall, floods, gully and sheet erosion, snow avalanches and aeolian processes. Currently, however, the key topic is the study of landslide movements. The activities of the laboratory are focused not only on solving case studies but also on the development of dendrogeomorphological methods. For the geomorphological processes studied, not only their chronology but also their spatio-temporal occurrence and potential triggers are reconstructed. The activities of the laboratory are spread over the Czech part of the Outer Western Carpathians, the Czech Hercynian Mountains and the České Středohoří Mts. The foreign regions are the High and Western Tatras, the Slovenské rudohoří Mts., the Borská nížina lowland (Slovakia), the Gory kamienne (Poland), the Calimani Mountains (Romania), and the Crimean Mountains (Ukraine). In these areas, the laboratory has contributed to the understanding of the behaviour of natural hazards over the last up to 300 years, including their seismic and hydrometeorological triggers. Research results are published exclusively in impacted scientific journals (mostly Q1 ranking; e.g. Catena, Geomorphology, Science of the Total Environment, Engineering Geology, Landslides, Dendrochronology, Earth Surface Processes and Landforms etc.). Since the establishment of the laboratory in 2007, more than 70 IF papers have been produced and more than 60 students (B.Sc., M.Sc. and PhD) have defended their theses on dendrogeomorphology. The laboratory also participated in 9 projects of the Czech Science Foundation (GAČR), three of which it was the main investigator. The laboratory also hosts foreign students (e.g. Slovakia, Poland, Romania). The laboratory has modern equipment for field sampling (sets of Pressler increment borers, increment hammers, hand and chain saws, etc.), their laboratory preparation (vibrating, oscillating, belt and cylindrical grinders, electric and cordless planers, band saw) and analysis (dendrochronological measuring tables, stereoscopic microscopes, specialized software). In addition, the laboratory is also equipped for microscopic analysis of the anatomical structure of the tree rings (sledge microtome, core microtome, chemical laboratory, specialised software). The laboratory cooperates with domestic and foreign workplaces (Switzerland, Slovakia, Romania, Hungary, Japan, China, Mexico, Brazil, USA, etc.) and offers further cooperation. 
	
The Laboratory offers cooperation on issues related to: 
\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep0em 
	\item chronology
	\item spatio-temporal occurrence
	\item determination of magnitude x frequency
	\item evaluation of potential triggers

{Mining-induced subsidence is a worldwide environmental problem that leads to damage to infrastructure and property; thus, knowledge of its past–recent development is critically needed during land-use planning. We dated the activity of gravitational processes related to mining-induced subsidence using dendrogeomorphic methods at four sites in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin near the former mines of the Karviná mining district. The landslide/subsidence sites were characterised by scarps, rotated blocks, stepped relief with grabens, pressure folds, and shallow movements within landslide toes or within flat undulating relief. Based on 644 increment cores from 161 trees, we were able to identify subsidence/landslide activity, with the most frequent responses occurring from the late 1950s to the early 1970s and from 2005 to 2011. The highest number of tree ring records dates back to 1973. Moreover, more than 30\% of tilted trees from the landslide sites created compression wood at multiple directions indicated complex deformations. At the other sites, the occasional occurrence of single rings with isolated compression wood was included as a possible indicator of events due to frequent coincidence with common series of compression wood. A comparison of tree-ring-based chronology with in situ monitoring revealed good synchronicity with the periods of increased subsidence rates (between 1 and 3 m.year\textsuperscript{−1}). In addition, not only mining operations, but also the occurrence of extreme rainfall seems to be responsible for the recent surface activity. We identified that the 3-year precipitation and the Simple daily intensity index were significantly higher during event years at the site with a flatter topography and clay soils (p=0.02 and 0.01, respectively). Since dendrogeomorphic research on subsidence is influenced by multiple factors, including geological settings, soil conditions, or surface morphology, future research should focus on small research plots that provide detailed tree, surface, and subsurface characteristics. In addition, another challenge is to compare broadleaved and coniferous trees in terms of their sensitivity to recording subsidence movements on the same geomorphic forms.

{spontaneous renaturalization, river channel development, channel migration zone, flood, European Beaver (Castor fiber), Beskid Wyspowy Mts.}%keywords
{Rivers in Polish part of Carpathians are heavily modified. Valleys are urbanized, banks are enforced, channels are straightened and various types of barriers are employed to regulate the flow. All these alterations cause disturbance of natural morphodynamic processes and destruction of habitats. Anthropogenic pressure may also increase risks related to floods and droughts.
	
	Contrary to the trends prevailing in the industrial era, more and more attention is now being paid to the negative effects of river regulation (e.g. Gregory, 2006). Growing awareness of the importance of preserving or restoring the natural state of rivers and water resources for the proper functioning of the environment and people leads to implementation of river restoration projects (e.g. Wohl et al., 2005). However, such actions are expensive and therefore not carried out on a large scale. That is why all factors that may cause renaturalization process to occur without technical treatment deserve special consideration.
	
	Some rivers display tendencies to partially compensate for the disturbances via spontaneous changes of various parameters such as sinuosity and wideness (e.g. Bollati et al., 2014). When left not maintained training structures may deteriorate in time. Eventually such constructions collapses and therefore natural hydromorphological processes may be restored to some extent, especially with external help.
	
	One of the key features characteristic for the multithread natural or semi-natural river is heterogeneity of the flow. Frequently such conditions are not met in regulated part of rivers. To help restore natural state we may employ various expensive technical measures or we can let it be done by the beavers (Castor fiber) which are known for their ability to create heterogeneous (aquatic and terrestrial) habitats (e.g. Rosell et al., 2005).
	
	We examined channel development of gravel-bed river Łososina in Beskid Wyspowy Mts. (Western Carpathians). During this project both of these factors were found to be important for spontaneous renaturalization. Analyses were conducted using data concerning river training made by RZGW (1973–2015), orthophotos, aerial photos, topographic maps (1845-1877, 1963-2018) and field surveys (2018-2019). 
	
	Historically (in XIX century) Łososina had multithread planar course on most of its length and wide channel migration zone. Intensification of the river training in second half of XX century resulted in simplification of planar pattern and shrinking of migration zone. From XX to XXI century riverbed was also incised by 2.5 m. During our study we determined five distinctive river sections that spontaneously increased its sinuosity and migration area despite continuous river training efforts.
	
	So defined process of spontaneous renaturalization took place both gradually and abruptly during research period. The greatest changes in sinuosity coincided in time with flood events. Such processes resulted in development of wandering pattern. While manoeuvring on a greater area river gets access to a wider range and bigger amounts of materials to promote channel heterogeneity and evolution. When it erodes new areas it acquires wood debris, gravel and sand which later becomes foundations for bars, islands, backwaters etc. Newly created sediments becomes unique dynamic habitats for pioneer plants and animals in constant cycle of destruction and recreation.
	
	Beavers occupy almost the entire length of Łososina river but their dams were observed only on the analyzed five sections. In zones of active channel migration water in old abandoned threads is preserved for years by impoundments created by beavers. Furthermore thus created more stagnant waters present new ecological niches.
	
	Though the area covered by those five more dynamic sections is much smaller than the historical extent of active migration it serves as so called “beads on string” (as described by Ward et al., 2002). Such system of retention zones and areas more resilient to disturbances may work as stepping stones for river connected species. Unfortunately due to continuous river management ability to spontaneously restore natural processes in Łososina is restricted.

{Construction of a high check dam on mountain Krzczonówka Stream, Polish Carpathians, in the mid-20th century resulted in a number of detrimental changes to the downstream reach. Entrapment of bed material behind the dam caused long-lasting sediment starvation of the downstream reach leading to channel incision and transformation of the former alluvial channel into a bedrock-alluvial or bedrock channel. High flow capacity of the incised channel was reflected in high velocity and bed shear stress associated with flood discharges of given recurrence interval, which prevented in-channel deposition of bed material in case of its delivery from the upstream reach. Concentration of flood flows in the incised channel considerably reduced floodwater retention in the floodplain area, hence contributing to rapid downstream passage of flood waves and increase in their peak discharges. Finally, hydromorphological quality of the stream was degraded as a result of morphological, sedimentary and hydraulic changes in the downstream reach coupled with the disruption of longitudinal stream continuity for aquatic biota caused by the check dam. 
	
	In 2012 a restoration project was initiated to lower the check dam and make the structure passable for fish. To trap the sediment flushed out from the dam reservoir in the incised channel, several block ramps were constructed in 2013, before the onset of the works on the check dam. The check dam was lowered in 2014 and when the works were underway, a 7-year flood occurred on the stream, flushing out a considerable amount of sediment from the dam reservoir. The sediment was efficiently trapped by the block ramps in the downstream reach. This study aims at investigating how the environmental problems caused by the long-term sediment starvation of the stream were mitigated by the restoration works. 
	
	Channel morphology was surveyed after the installation of block ramps but with still unmodified check dam (2013) and after the check-dam lowering (2015). These surveys were done in 10 cross-sections delimited in the downstream reach of the stream. Data about cross-sectional stream morphology, channel slope as well as channel and floodplain roughness were used in hydraulic modelling of flood conditions typifying the stream before (2013) and after (2015) deposition of the sediment trapped by block ramps. The modelling was performed using HEC-RAS software. Moreover, hydromorphological quality of the stream was evaluated in 2012 and 2015 according to the River Hydromorphological Quality method, which is especially suitable for the assessment of effects of river restoration activities (Hajdukiewicz et al., 2017). 
	
	Deposition of the sediment flushed out from above the lowered check dam caused burying of the boulder ramps on the distance of 1.2 km from the dam, whereas the sediment wave reached 1.6 km from the dam. About 15650 m3 of bed material were retained in the stream, resulting in re-establishment of alluvial channel bed and an average aggradation of the channel bed by 0.50 m. Bed aggradation and the resultant increase in the elevation of low-flow water surface were relatively large close to the check dam, attaining maximum values of around 1 m at the distance of 440 m from the dam, and decreased in the downstream direction. As bed aggradation reduced flow capacity of the channel, unit stream power and bed shear stress in the channel zone of the stream decreased, with the largest decrease of these parameters by 36\% and 30\%, respectively, recorded for a 20-year flood. These changes were reflected in reduced competence of the stream, with the average reduction of entrainable grain size of bed material by 18\% for a 2-year flood and by 31\% for the 20-year flood. The reduction in flow capacity of the channel increased retention potential of the floodplain, i.e. a proportion of the total cross-sectional flow area in which floodwater would remain motionless, thus being temporarily retained on the floodplain (Wyżga, 1999; Czech et al., 2016). However, this effect was not statistically significant in the set of 10 study cross-section, but was relatively large where the channel bed aggraded substantially, while small in the cross-sections with a small increase in bed elevation. Before the restoration works, only 1 of the 5 evaluated stream cross-sections was classified as representing good hydromorphological quality, whereas after the works 4 cross-sections fell in this class of hydromorphological quality. The hydromorphological quality improvement mainly reflected changes in bed substrate, erosional and depositional channel features and longitudinal stream connectivity. 
	
	To conclude, inventories performed before and after the restoration works demonstrated effectiveness of block ramps in mitigating problems in the physical functioning of an incised mountain stream. With the entrapment of bed material by block ramps, channel bed considerably aggraded and changed from the bedrock to an alluvial one. The bed aggradation significantly decreased bed shear stress and entrainable grain size of bed material. Floodwater retention in the floodplain area increased, although this effect was largely dependent on the amount of bed aggradation in the study cross-sections. The hydromorphological quality of the stream improved in 4 out of the 5 evaluated cross-sections, with 3 cross-sections being upgraded from moderate to good quality class.
